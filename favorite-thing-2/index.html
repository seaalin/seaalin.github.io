    <title>My Favorite Thing About School</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>There are a lot of interesting subjects at school, especially at EPS</h1>
    <h2>I've also taken a lot of classes throughout my time here (7 years?) so I think I'm pretty <br> qualified to answer this question</h2>
    <p>
        Honestly, I think that my favorite class has to be Stagecraft.
        <br>
        <br> Some things that I like about it are:
        <ul>
            <li>Making things for the play</li>
            <li>Using different tools to make that stuff aka power tools :)</li>
            <li>I honestly just find it really fun and grafitying to make things for other people that they can use</li>
        </ul>
