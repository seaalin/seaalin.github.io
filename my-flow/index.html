    Hobbies?

<body>
    <p>
        I honestly have a lot of hobbies that I've started but honestly it's really hard for me to stick to them.
        <br>
        <br> I really like spending my time outdoors through different volunteering programs.
        <br>
        <br> One place that I've really enjoyed volunteering at is SAFE, which is a horse rescue/rehabilitation program out in Redmond, right near where I live.
        <br>
        <br> Some other places that I have volunteered at are:
        <ul>
            <li>Hopelink</li>
            <li>WTA</li>
            <li>Different summer camps</li>
            <li>And more!</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <table>
            <tr style="color:blue">
                <th>Interesting Fact 1</th>
                <th>Interesting Fact 2</th>
                <th>Interesting Fact 3</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>a</td>
                <td>b</td>
                <td>c</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>d</td>
                <td>e</td>
                <td>f</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>g</td>
                <td>h</td>
                <td>i</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <br> I also really enjoy hiking, camping, and many other outdoor activities.
