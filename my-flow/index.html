    <p>
        I honestly have a lot of hobbies that I've started but honestly it's really hard for me to stick to them.
        <br>
        <br> I really like spending my time outdoors through different volunteering programs.
        <br>
        <br> One place that I've really enjoyed volunteering at is SAFE, which is a horse rescue/rehabilitation program out in Redmond, right near where I live.

        <br> I also really enjoy hiking, camping, and many other outdoor activities.
